1. Adding AIA and CRL Distribution Points to the Certification Authority
___________________________
By navigating to the Properties of the root CA in **the certification autority **( we are still doing this remotly ) and access the Extensions tab.

Specify the location where the CRL will be published by adding a URL in the following format
    
    http://www.domain1.dz/pki/<CAName><CRLSuffix><DeltaCRLAllowed>.crl
    
Ensure to enable the options Include in CRLs (to allow delta CRL lookup) and Include in the CDP extension of issued certificates so that the CRL information is embedded in all issued certificates.
Add another URL to define the location of the CA's certificate, such as:

    http://www.domain1.dz/pki/<DNSName>_<CAName><CertName>.crt
Enable Include in the AIA extension of issued certificates so that issued certificates can reference this location to retrieve the CA’s certificate.

-> These extensions define where the CRL and root certificate can be accessed by clients. 
Within the CA management console, administrators adjust the properties of the root CA to add these extensions. 
The CRL Distribution Point (CDP) URL specifies the public location where the CRL will be made available. 
Typically, this is a web URL that clients can access, such as http://www.domain1.dz/pki/


2. Creating a Public Directory for the CRL and Root Certificate
______________________

To make the CRL and CA certificate accessible, a dedicated directory is created on the public web server. 
This involves connecting to the server remotely and creating a folder under the web server’s default directory, 
typically Inetpub\wwwroot. A folder named PKI is set up to house the CRL file and the CA certificate.

The folder acts as a publicly available repository where clients and systems can retrieve the latest CRL and root certificate.
This setup is crucial for enabling external users to verify certificates issued by the CA, especially when revocation or trust validation is required.

3. Publishing the CRL and Root Certificate
________________________

The CA generates the CRL file and the root certificate during its operation. 
These files are stored locally on the CA server. To publish them, they are copied from the CA to the newly created PKI directory on the web server. 
By doing this, the files become accessible through URLs like http://www.domain.com/pki/1dRootCA.crl and http://www.domain.com/pki/1dRootCA.crt.

This step is vital for ensuring the availability of revocation data and the CA certificate. 
Systems and users can now validate certificates against the CRL or download the CA’s certificate to establish trust. 
Such accessibility is a foundational aspect of any PKI, especially in environments requiring strong security measures and centralized certificate management.

4. Testing and Verifying the Configuration 
______________
Once the setup is complete, the configuration must be tested to confirm its functionality. 
On a client machine, a new certificate is requested using the Certificate Enrollment Wizard. 
This issued certificate is then examined to ensure that the AIA and CDP extensions point to the newly configured URLs. 
These extensions should reflect the public web locations where the CRL and CA certificate are hosted.

To validate the CRL and certificate accessibility, the URLs are tested to ensure they are reachable and that the appropriate files can be downloaded. 
Additionally, the certificate properties are reviewed to confirm that the CA certificate is correctly chained and trusted, and the CRL information is valid.

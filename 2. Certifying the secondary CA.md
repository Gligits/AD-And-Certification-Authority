# Concept 
During this step we are gonne be using the Root CA remotly ( from the secondary CA ) trough the computer managment interface 
Here's why this is done:

1. Practicality in Real Environments
In real-world scenarios administrators often manage servers remotely for convenience and security. 
The Root CA (DC1) is typically highly secured and might not be logged into directly to reduce risk.
Managing it remotely (from Server1 aka the Subordinate CA in this case) ensures separation of responsibilities and minimizes unnecessary access to the Root CA.

2. Verifying Connectivity and Delegated Trust
By performing these steps from Server1, we're also testing the network communication and delegation of administrative roles. 

3. Centralized Control and Redirection
Redirecting the CA authority allows Server1 to confirm that it recognizes DC1 as the Root CA. 
This setup also prepares the infrastructure for real-world deployment, where multiple subordinate CAs might need to work with a centralized Root CA.

# Steps 
1. Issuing the Subordinate CA Certificate
____________________________________
When setting up the subordinate CA (secondary CA), a certificate request is generated and saved on the local disk (C:) as a .req file. 
To process this request, we connect to the root CA (DC1) from Server1 using **the Computer Management interface**. 
From this interface, we submit the saved request file to the root CA. 
The root CA then reviews and approves the request within its management console. 
This approval process generates the subordinate CAâ€™s certificate, which is subsequently saved and transferred back to Server1 for installation. 
This certificate, issued by the root CA, establishes the subordinate CA's identity and integrates it into the PKI hierarchy, allowing it to issue certificates as a trusted authority. 

2. Installing the Subordinate CA Certificate
_______________________________________
To install the subordinate CA certificate we need to import the certificate issued by the root CA on the subordinate CA server
Then open **the Certification Authority Console** on the subordinate CA server (Server1).

Go to Start then Administrative Toolsand select Certification Authority.
In the consolewe'll right-click on the subordinate CA  and select All Tasks > Install CA Certificate.
Exporting the certificate in a standard format (such as DER-encoded .CER) ensures compatibility for importing it into the subordinate CA, completing the trust chain setup between the root and subordinate CAs.

3. Validating the Subordinate CA
_______________________________
The subordinate CA undergoes a validation process to ensure it functions as intended. 
We should examine the certificate to confirm that it was issued by the root CA and that it includes accurate details, such as the validity period and designated key usages. 
We inspect the path verifying that the subordinate CA's certificate chain correctly links back to the root CA, establishing its place in the trust hierarchy.

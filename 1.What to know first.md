# AD-Setting-Up-a-Secondary-Enterprise-Certification-Authority
Installing a root and a secondary CA, configure the CRL and AIA distribution points, and then verify that the entire system works as expected
# Some general concepts : 

## What is PKI(Public Key Infrastructure) ?
It is like a system ( an infrastucture ) that helps everyone in a network communicate securely. It ensures that:
- You know who you're talking to (identity verification).
- Your conversation stays private (encryption).
- Nobody can change the message without you knowing (integrity).
Like a system for your network, where only trusted people (users or devices) can get an ID and everyone agrees to trust those IDs.

## What is a certificate ? 
It is the ID in your system (PKI) and it proves two things:

- Who you are: It verifies that the person, website, or device is really who they claim to be.
- That you're trustworthy: It shows that a trusted authority (like a CA) has checked and approved your identity.

## What Does a Certificate Contain? ?
- Name: Who the certificate is for (e.g a website like "bank.com" or a device).
- Public Key: A key used for encrypting and verifying messages. 
- Issuer: Who created and signed the certificate (usually a CA).
- Validity Dates: When the certificate starts and stops being valid (like an expiration date).
- Serial Number: A unique number to track the certificate.
- Signature: A stamp of approval from the CA proving the certificate hasn’t been tampered with.

## How The PKI works :

1. Public and Private Keys:
- PKI is based on a "lock and key" system.
- The private key stays secret (known only to you).
- The public key is shared with others using your certificate.

2. The Certificate's Job:
- It introduces your public key to others and proves it’s safe to use.

3. Verification:
When someone gets your certificate, they check its authenticity by verifying the CA signature.
If the CA is trusted, the certificate is trusted, too.

# Details about the setup 
## Root CA ( named DC1 )

We are gonna be using a windows server **let's name it DC1** both as**the Root CA and a Domain Controller**. 
This Root CA is the primary trust anchor of the entire PKI hierarchy, meaning all certificates issued in this environment ultimately rely on it. Here’s its roles : 

1. Issuing Certificates: He cas issue its own certificates and sign certificates** for subordinate CAs**. 
In our environment it’s responsible for creating the initial trust chain by signing the Subordinate CA certificate, thereby authorizing it to issue certificates to other network entities.

2. Self-Signed Certificate: He can generate a self-signed certificate, as it’s at the top of the trust chain. This certificate will be trusted by all devices and users within the domain, providing a base layer of security.

3.Certificate Management: Since it’s also a Domain Controller the DC1 is central to the network’s identity and access management. 
As a Root CA, it strengthens authentication mechanisms within the domain by allowing issued certificates to support secure login processes, digital signatures, and data encryption.

-> note that to enhance security the root CA should be as isolated as possible. so you should be using an isolated vmnet 

## Subordinate CA ( named server1 )

It acts as an intermediate certificate authority below the Root CA. 
It issues certificates to clients or other network services and helps distribute the certification workload. 
Here’s its role : 
1. Trusted Certificate Chain: 
The Subordinate CA’s certificate was signed by the Root CA, so any certificate it issues inherits the trust from the Root CA. 
Devices in the network will trust certificates from the Subordinate CA because they can trace back to the trusted Root CA.

2. Certificate Issuance:
The Subordinate CA’s main role is to issue certificates on behalf of the Root CA. 
This might include certificates for users, servers, web applications, and other domain services within the network.

3. Enhanced Security: 
By using a two-tier CA structure with the Root CA issuing certificates only to the Subordinate CA and the Subordinate CA handling other certificates, **the Root CA is protected**. 
This setup minimizes the risk to the Root CA, as the Subordinate CA can be isolated from it, and any compromise of the Subordinate CA does not affect the Root CA directly.


## Web server : 

It will distribute information about the CA structure to users and devices in the network. 
Here’s how it relates to certificates:

1. CRL Distribution Point:

Hosts the Certificate Revocation List (CRL), making it available for download to clients. 
-> A CRL is a list of certificates that have been revoked, and making this list publicly accessible is essential for security. 
When a device checks a certificate, it also checks the CRL to ensure that the certificate hasn’t been revoked.
If a certificate is compromised, expired or no longer needed, it’s added to the CRL to alert systems not to trust it.

2. AIA (Authority Information Access): 

The Web Server also hosts the AIA URLs, providing access to the Root CA and Subordinate CA certificates. 
These URLs are included in issued certificates, allowing clients to verify the certificate chain. For example, a client can download the CA certificate from the AIA URL to verify the authenticity of the Subordinate CA or end-entity certificate.

## Client Machine : 
How and when will the cleint machine interact with the certificate environment?

1.For Trust Verification: 
When connects to other network resources, it will validate certificates by following the trust chain back to the Root CA. The client machine uses both the AIA URLs and the CRL to confirm that the certificates it encounters are legitimate, unrevoked, and trustworthy.

2. For Securing Communication: 
By using certificates for identity verification the can securely communicate with other network services (like web servers or applications) and ensure that the data exchanged is encrypted and protected from interception.

3. For User Authentication: 
If user certificates are issued the client  can use them for user authentication within the domain. 
For example, the client could use certificates to log in securely without needing a password, relying on two-factor authentication (e.g: a smart card and a PIN) for additional security.

-> Basically the client machine benefits from the PKI structure by trusting only certificates that have been validated and by enjoying secure, encrypted communications within the network.
